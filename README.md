This repository contains the code for a Forex trading robot developed for MultiCharts MT5. It is designed to execute trades based on predefined criteria and is intended to be used as a sample code that can work as described in the product.

## Product Description

This Forex trading robot is developed for MultiCharts MT5, a popular trading platform. It is designed to automate the process of trading by executing trades based on predefined criteria. The robot uses a combination of indicators and criteria to determine when to enter and exit trades.

The robot is programmed to check for four predefined criteria before executing a trade. These criteria can be customized according to the user's preferences. Once all criteria are met, the robot calculates the lot size based on available margin and places a market order with the calculated lot size.

The take profit and stop loss levels for each trade are set at a predefined number of points, which can also be customized. The robot uses the current bid and ask prices to calculate these levels.

The robot also includes functions to calculate the lot size based on available margin and to initialize necessary variables and indicators. Additionally, it includes a function to clean up resources and close any open trades when the program is stopped.
